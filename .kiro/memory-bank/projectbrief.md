# Visual Artifact Studio - Project Brief

## Project Overview

Visual Artifact Studio is a revolutionary no-code platform that combines visual design power, live coding environment, and cutting-edge AI to create interactive React components from natural language descriptions.

**Core Concept**: Think Figma meets CodeSandbox meets AI.

## Current Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.7 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **State Management**: React hooks with Zustand patterns
- **Real-time**: LiveBlocks integration for collaboration features
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI service for component generation

## Key Features

- Visual canvas with drag & drop interface
- AI-powered component generation
- Live preview with hot reload
- Component library with templates
- Style customization panel
- Version control integration
- Code export functionality

## New Task: Auto-Deployment Integration

### Requirements

Implement automatic deployment integrations for:

1. **Vercel** - Direct deployment with API integration
2. **Netlify** - Git-based deployment with API integration
3. **GitHub Pages** - Repository-based deployment

### Integration Goals

- Seamless one-click deployment from the UI
- Real-time deployment status monitoring
- Configuration management for each platform
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Deployment history tracking

### Technical Considerations

- Use Next.js server actions for backend operations
- Implement OAuth flows for platform authentication
- Create reusable deployment providers pattern
- Add proper error boundaries and loading states
- Ensure secure credential management

### UI Integration

- Add deployment panel to existing ArtifactBuilder interface
- Include platform selection interface
- Show deployment progress and status
- Provide deployment history and logs
- Support bulk deployment operations

## Success Criteria

- Users can deploy to all three platforms from a single interface
- Deployment process is fully automated and user-friendly
- Error recovery is robust and informative
- Integration works with existing project structure
- Performance impact is minimal
