# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Visual Artifact Studio is a revolutionary no-code platform that combines the visual design capabilities of Figma with the interactive development environment of CodeSandbox, enhanced by AI assistance. It enables users to create interactive React components through drag-and-drop interfaces, natural language AI generation, and real-time preview capabilities. The platform serves as both a visual builder and a marketplace for reusable component templates, making complex UI development accessible to designers, developers, and content creators alike.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create interactive components using a visual drag-and-drop interface with real-time preview, so that I can rapidly build complex UI without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the artifact studio THEN the system SHALL display a canvas area, component library, and live preview panel
2. WHEN a user drags a component from the library THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and allow dropping onto the canvas
3. WHEN a component is dropped on the canvas THEN the system SHALL create a ComponentNode with position, size, and default properties
4. WHEN a user modifies a component THEN the system SHALL update the live preview in real-time with hot reload
5. WHEN a user selects a component THEN the system SHALL show selection handles and highlight the component
6. IF a component supports children THEN the system SHALL allow nested component placement with visual indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to customize component properties and styling through a visual interface, so that I can achieve the exact look and behavior I need without writing CSS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a component THEN the system SHALL display a properties panel with editable fields
2. WHEN a user modifies a component property THEN the system SHALL update the component in real-time
3. WHEN a user changes styling properties THEN the system SHALL apply the styles immediately to the canvas
4. WHEN a user sets position and size properties THEN the system SHALL update the component's visual position and dimensions
5. IF a property has validation rules THEN the system SHALL validate input and show error messages for invalid values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate code for my visual components in different frameworks, so that I can integrate them into my existing projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a component design THEN the system SHALL provide a code generation option
2. WHEN a user selects a target framework THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate code for React, Vue, or Svelte
3. WHEN a user selects a styling approach THEN the system SHALL generate code using TailwindCSS, CSS, or styled-components
4. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL include all component properties, styles, and structure
5. IF the component has interactivity THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate event handlers and state management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and test my components in a sandbox environment, so that I can verify they work correctly before using them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a preview THEN the system SHALL render the component in an isolated sandbox
2. WHEN the component has interactive elements THEN the system SHALL enable full interactivity in the preview
3. WHEN there are errors in the component THEN the system SHALL display error messages and prevent broken previews
4. WHEN the preview is successful THEN the system SHALL return the rendered HTML and any console output
5. IF the component uses external dependencies THEN the system SHALL load them in the sandbox environment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to save and reuse my component designs as templates, so that I can build a library of reusable components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a component design THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save as template
2. WHEN saving a template THEN the system SHALL require a name, description, and category
3. WHEN a template is saved THEN the system SHALL store the complete component structure and metadata
4. WHEN a user browses templates THEN the system SHALL display them organized by category with previews
5. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL load it into the canvas for further editing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate complex interactive components from natural language prompts using AI, so that I can create sophisticated functionality like calculators, quizzes, and data visualizations instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language prompt THEN the system SHALL accept framework, styling, and interactivity preferences
2. WHEN a user submits prompts like "Create a loan calculator with sliders" THEN the system SHALL generate a fully interactive calculator component
3. WHEN a user requests "Make a data visualization for sales" THEN the system SHALL create chart components with sample data
4. WHEN a user asks for "Build a quiz about React" THEN the system SHALL generate an interactive quiz widget with questions and scoring
5. WHEN AI generation completes THEN the system SHALL execute the code in a sandbox and display the working component
6. IF AI generation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information and alternative suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate version control and A/B testing for my artifacts, so that I can manage component evolution and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves an artifact THEN the system SHALL create a version entry with timestamp and changes
2. WHEN a user creates component variants THEN the system SHALL enable A/B testing framework setup
3. WHEN components are deployed THEN the system SHALL monitor performance metrics automatically
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide optimization suggestions
5. IF a component has multiple versions THEN the system SHALL allow comparison and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to share and discover components through a template marketplace, so that I can leverage community-created artifacts and contribute my own.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an artifact THEN the system SHALL provide options to publish to the marketplace
2. WHEN browsing the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display components with previews, ratings, and usage statistics
3. WHEN a user finds a useful template THEN the system SHALL allow one-click import into their workspace
4. WHEN publishing a template THEN the system SHALL require documentation, tags, and usage examples
5. IF a template receives updates THEN the system SHALL notify users who have imported it

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want my components to be automatically optimized for different screen sizes and devices, so that they work seamlessly across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate responsive breakpoints
2. WHEN previewing components THEN the system SHALL provide mobile, tablet, and desktop view modes
3. WHEN components use interactive elements THEN the system SHALL optimize touch targets for mobile devices
4. WHEN performance testing runs THEN the system SHALL measure load times across different device types
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL suggest automatic optimizations
